=========================
 Post-alpha related work
=========================

TLDR
====

Sam, Alex and Julien went through the alpha release and tried to come up with an overview of the work that is waiting for us post alpha.


modus operandi
--------------

We did that trying to answer these questions:

1. Are there any requirements of oscoin on radicle to be able to execute on that vision?
2. What did we cut from alpha?
3. What are the main usibility challenges of Radicle at this moment?
4. What are some common feature requests we are expecting from our community
5. User feedback through user testing (not done yet)


Afterwards we split the answers into 1 of three buckets:

1. Code collaboration
2. Radicle stack
3. Radicle language
