==================================
Radicle Protocol Principles
==================================

*radicle* is **hierarchical**
-----------------------------

Growing from a single root node and branching into sub-trees, radicle represents hierarchical data and structures.


*radicle* is **programmable**
-----------------------------

Any sub-tree can have its own rules and can be programmed to infuse different semantics into different branches.

*radicle* is **self-amendable**
-------------------------------
Radicle programs can modify themselves as part of their semantics.

*radicle* is **content-centric**
--------------------------------
The radicle tree is organized around data first and people second.

*radicle* enables **shared ownership**
--------------------------------------
Through its hierarchical structure, radicle enables coordination around data, governance, and shared ownership.

*radicle* enables **decentralization**
--------------------------------------
Radicle sub-trees are independent from each other.
