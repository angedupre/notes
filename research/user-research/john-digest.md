# John - user test

## Website

- would probaby come from twitter, hacker news
- look at 3 paragraphs
- apps written in lisp, interesting
- would go to blog first
- garden is something he doesn't know about so would click there to see what terminology means
- like the ASCII art style, doesn't quite understand what it's about
- didn't see that he could scroll down initial page, would have left after going to the garden
- don't know what exactly it's trying to do
- not clear what's happening
- would have to know what IPFS is and don't really know
- assume it has to do with github-type issues
- wouldn't know how lisp connects unless
- "what is the radicle network?"
- don't know what the radicle network is
- cory: do you know what a radicle project is? -- a: like a git repo, seems clear
- dealing with issues for the projects
- delt with git a lot before
- don't exactly understand "diff" but kind of get it's related to PRs
- like the globe -- looks like the death star
- find it's wierd that links are at the bottom of the page
- about for instance, might want that at the top
- "collaboration emerges organically" kind of confusing on about page
- would wait to see another friend tell him about it before going further
- so much stuff going on that it's better to ignore most projects
- tech is just not something that he might care about on his own
- assume trusted friend has written a blog post
- do a search for "install" on home page

## Terminal installation

- open up terminal and clone repo, do stack install
- "stack help" to see what's going on
- requires 2 background processes, wouldn't do that yet -- "do they need to be running the background or do they just need to be run from a certain location?"
- should put an "&" sign because they don't background themselves
- speed reading tutorial pt 1
- seems like I'm checking out a project like I would a git project
- opens "git gui"
- sees that there are files in the repo -- even though they aren't exactly the same
- cory: what is it that you think you're doing here -- a: run through some basics, expect it to last about 5mim -- what can I actually do here
- would have had some context about
- "how to people get green cactuses in their terminal????"
- something is weird with the certificate *just* on the garden page
- kind of confused about this community garden
- looks like static page, doesn't look like people can contribute
- "rad issue list" "cool"
- having output in the terminal that I don't expect
- IPFS query tags in the terminal that I don't expect with rad issue list
- differences between the tutorial and output -- concerned that this might not be as easy as I thought
- starts skimming comment
- makes new branch and checks it out
- somone already has default text file name
- would create a garden outside of the dimensions on purpose and see what happens
- command didn't work as expected because we need to add untracked files
- "rad diff propose HEAD" got a whole bunch of debug output
- he ran daemons as background processes, ouputs then come through

## Rejected output

- haha, was rejected. would be interested to see why it wasn't accepted
- going to kill the daemons in the background
- try it a bit differently
- want a cool garden, so go to ascii art archive asciiart.eu
- can you do a force push with rad, over the last commit
- overwrite last commit so it's not globally visible
- diff is being proposed -- set of git diffs is being proposed
- assume it's the second one on the same branch
- thought that the old one would hav been overwritten rather than having them both show up
- rad diff help
- go to rad retract
- oh it didn't work -- assume it's my fault
- two commits were sent over the wire, rather than one. didn't accept the last proposal, so trying to accep this proposal failed
- starts pt. 2 of tutorial
- chose option 1, IPFS repo
- "how do I get an already-created git repo onto radicle"
- after using radicle I might want to port my existing projects
- wish I could continue without the friend in this part
- will just read through 
- would stop at this point, think about how I might implement this
- might read up on the technical stuff later

## Overall thoughts

- don't understand what the radicle network is
- know it's on IPFS, but don't know where that is exactly
- especially the whitepaper at the bottom, seems like that should be at the top
- where is the data hosted? is it there indefinitely
- probably go back to him with some questions. wonder why I should host it there vs my own hosting

## Follow-up questions

- where would you exect to come across this: hacker news
- prior knowledge of P2P/blockchain: messed around with bitcoin a bit and that's it -- know more about it theoritically than practically
- git?: know more about radicle commands because I know git
- experimental: didn't come across -- more interested in messing around with it -- if it's experimental I would probably wait until it's stable
- website vs tools: from the site didn't get a clear grasp on what it's about -- only going through tutorial -- how can I expose these projects to people not on the radicle network, is that possible?
- docs helpful?: liked going through tutorial before going through docs
- FAQ is always worthwhile to get through, didn't check it out but clicking through now
- would you want to contribute to a project like this: not normall someone who would do that kind of thing
- if you were to do contribute how would that happen: past experience has said this is a waste of time
- moved all projects off raspberry pi
