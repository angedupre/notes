# User Testing Sarah

## Key take aways

- She often expressed that she only skimming through pages to get a general feel but did not read the details. This meant she missed a lot of information.
- Decentralised Github is not big enough selling point to seriously start using it.
- Used a lot of copy/paste of code from the docs.
- She spend a lot of time inspecting the readme on Github.
- She was confused about the messaging. From the website whe got “decentralised Github” but from the readme “programming environment”.
- She wants to know what commands do, which files they create before running them.
- Was very intrigued by the nature metaphor, especially the garden.
- She skipped the issues part of of the tutorial and was not interested in the second part (though we ran out of time).
- She only looked at the “Tutorial Part 1” and “Install” sections from the docs


## Background
- She has already heard about Radicle from the talk and calls it a “programming environment”
- She is familiar with the P2P and crypto space

## Log

### On home page
- She clicks on “Garden” in the top navigation because it is different from all the other terms and sounds the most intriguing.

### On “Garden” page

- “Garden is adorable”
- “Is this a pixel-selling website?”
- She does not feel committed enough to try the tutorial and wants to explore more
- Clicks on “Tutorial” from garden page

### On “Tutorial” page

- Tutorial section mentions that Radicle needs to be installed so she did not land in the right place.
- She likes the URLs like `radicle.xyz`.
- She scrolls and skimms through the tutorial without taking action
- She feels “to deep” into the tutorial and wants to get more context from the home page.

### On home page

- “What does the text under ‘Setup Project’ mean?”
- She is confused about what Radicle is. Term “network” is incompatible with her preconception of Radicle as a “programming environment”.
- Skipping to animation on home page
- “Radicle is P2P Github”
- “Does it integrate with Github? How can I migrate or sync Github projects?” The diagram seems to tell her “yes”, she can push to Github.
- The flowing red visuals looked like from a horror movie

### On Github project readme

- She is looking for recent activity to judge if the project is legitimate. When was the last commit? Last commit was four hours ago
- “From the readme it sounds like a programming environment”
- Skimming readme, not reading it too much
- Radicle seems legitimate from readme and activity
- Back to tutorial

### Installing

- The tutorial text mentions that you need to install Radicle. So back to install section.
- Copy and paste from “Debian” install section.
- She sees the “Background processes” section and is wondering whether the IPFS daemon is running. The install section did not mention it
- She pointed out the inconsistent naming between systemd services and daemon commands.

### On “Tutorial” page

- She copy-pastes `rad checkout`
- She inspects what has happened with `ls` and `git remote -v`
- She skips inspecting the issues because she had no issues with the project so far.
- “My goal is to make a garden”
- “It’s unclear whether `propse` creates something like a PR that is visible to everybody.”
- Does not see her diff in `diff list` output at first.
- She saw here computer’s name as the name in `diff list`. “I would like to specify my user name.”
- “I would like to see an accepted diff in my Github commit history”
- She goes to the Radicle garden page to see her commit
- “Radicle is an CLI extension of Git on IPFS”

### Github project readme

- She is confused by the contradicting message from the readme when compared to the website.
- She is interested in repogramability.
- She wants to use the REPL and tries to find it with `rad help`. That doesn’t work.
- She tries the `radicle` command from the “Usage” section. Does not work because there is no such file.

## Wrap-up

- She would here about Radicle from Sam, Cory, Github, Twitter, Crypto Circle
- She saw the note that it is alpha software. Because everything worked smoothly she would not consider it alpha software.
- “I did not quite get the [radicle and nature] metaphor”
- She did not have enough motivation to use it for a project.
- “I don’t want to desync from Github. It’s a resume and social network”

## Typos

- vegatables
- sewing
- deamon
- `apt install` should have `sudo` in fromnt
- `yyy-mm-dd` should have four `y`
