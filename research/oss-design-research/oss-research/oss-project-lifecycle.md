# Typical OSS project lifecycle

> See "Best case scenario" [here](https://lostechies.com/chadmyers/2009/05/28/lifecycle-of-an-open-source-project/)

## Phase 1: Concept

One person is running into trouble trying to build something, is looking around for projects to solve their problem. They see other people are asking the same questions, but are unable to find a ready made solution for it.They decide to build the solution themselves, they start a new project on Github.

## Phase 2: Bootstrap

They are just tapping away, trying to solve this problem. Maybe they share it with a friend developer to get some extra eyes on it. Will go to some IRC channels asking some specific questions.

## Phase 3: Early Development

There are a few more people interested, your solution is basic but it works. The few conversations they have about this project is with the one or 2 befriended developers they have told about the project. They write a small readme more for themselves then anybody else.

## Phase 4: Early Adoption

After being online for a few months, some people have starred it on Github. They've even got a few issues that were submitted. Because they are so happy that a person found it useful, they solve the issue quickly. They add a basic contribution guide outlining what way they expect PR's or issues to be submitted.

## Phase 5: Development

About 50 people have starred the repo. A few more issues are coming in a week now, some people have started complaining about the lack of clear documentation. It quickly sinks in that the maintainer is going to have to spend more time on this. They continue to patch some stuff, still building mainly to solve their own project.

## Phase 6: Adoption

More and more people are looking to contribute. The maintainer is starting to have certain issues that are a few weeks old. Also there are a few PR's that don't really reflect the direction that they want to take the project on.

## Phase 7: Mainstream

They stop really spending time on it since it solved the problem they set out to solve. They check in once every 3 months, ignoring the issues and conversations. Just goes straight to the PR's and seeing which ones have passed the tests, only those will they go through and merge in. This also shows the community that the repo is still being maintained.
Nobody is ever really coming in trying to help out, so the project just lives on like this.
