# OSS Space

## Problems in OSS

- Lack of funding for project maintainers
- Weird status of OSS as commons: if you write code and keep it to yourself you have more chance of being able to make money off of it versus when you share it it's part of the public domain. (eg if githubs' source code was open source it wouldn't be worth 7b)
- Infrastructure is such that the tooling can't be good
- Sense of alienation: you only know a small part of your community, only the ones that tell you what's wrong. Would be great to get an idea how many people benefit from it.
- The infrastructure people rely on is actually not properly maintained
- Volunteer burnout
- Community mismanagement

## Opportunities in OSS

- Adding monetary reward might prompt maintainers to take the built quality of their OSS more seriously
- Having access to primitives to create your own tooling
  - the internet is a detraction of the flexibility of the command line
  - for example, instead of having just a webpage sending you a GUI with the data in there, it could send you the GUI and the data separately and let you choose to see just the data or the default GUI with the data (e.g. [repo in a project on Github with all the issues](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/the_single_most_important_criteria_when_replacing_Github))
- Allow easier and more forms of contributions
- Providing more flexible funding options
  - Platform selling licenses
  - Platform for directly investing in a project
  - Free to try, pay to use in commercial space
- Set some standards when it comes to licensing, protecting the casual contributors to not be exploited.

## Great set of questions to answer:

Copied from [here](https://ford-foundation-6.forms.fm/digital-infrastructure-research-rfp/forms/4770):

- What makes an open source project “critical digital infrastructure”? How should we measure and prioritise support for digital infrastructure projects? How do organisations know what digital infrastructure they rely on and how do they assess the sustainability risks in these projects?
- What is the role that private companies should play in maintaining a stable ecosystem of open source technology? What are the tradeoffs involved between private sector, government, and/or volunteer maintenance of digital infrastructure? What parallels are there to the maintenance and support of other public goods, and what can we learn from those parallels?
- How could we better sustain the open source community? What is the relationship between money and sustainability for digital infrastructure projects? In which situations does money help or hurt?
- What defines a maintainer of a digital infrastructure project? What incentives do they have to maintain a project and how are more contributions incentivised? Are certain skills or expertise expertise missing or weak in the open source community, such as management experience, and how might they be strengthened?
- What are barriers to diversity and inclusion in the public interest infrastructure space? What are the barriers to entry to this community and how might we break them down? And how does open source software contribute to or counter efforts to build a more equitable society?
- What are the critical security weak points in our digital infrastructure? How do we mitigate those weak points?
