# Ways to funding OSS today

1. Bounties:

- On a small scale, individuals or companies sometimes post “bounties”, which are cash prizes for certain development milestones.
- They can however create perverse incentives for contributing to a project

2. Services:

- Consulting is a viable option for independent developers, if there are enough people using the project who are willing and able to pay for extra help.
- On a small scale, it can also distract developers from improving the project itself

3. Paid licenses:

- Some developers feel that licensing could provide at least a partial solution to open source’s funding problems. If open source projects are being heavily used, why not charge for them?
- This model is arguably at odds with the enormous social calie that open source has provided, which suggests that when software is free, innovation follows

4. Sponsorship or donations:

- A project maintainer will look for benefactors who believe in the value of their work and are willing to financially support them. There are two major sources of funding at the moment: software companies and other developers.

5. Crowdfunding:

- Similarly to bounties, crowdfunding can be useful for funding new features or development work with a clear, tangible outcome. It can also help reduce perverse incentives from bounties.
- Crowdfunding still does not address the need for funding related to ongoing operations and overhead, nor is it a recurring source of capital (time intensive)

6. Corporate sponsorship of infrastructure projects:

- On a larger scale, in some instances, a project’s value becomes so widely regarded that a company will hire a contributor to work on the project full-time.
- A concern is that a single company could have undue influence over a project, since they are the only sponsor.

7. Administrative support and fiscal sponsorship

- Several foundations provide organizational support, such as fiscal sponsorship, to open source projects in other words, taking care of the non-coding tasks that many developers would prefer not to do.
- It is important to note that these foundations provide legal and administrative, but rarely financial, support.

8. Creating a foundation to support a project

- Large enough projects can be managed through their own foundation
- Two important aspects to start a foundation are:
  - Qualifying for tax exempt status
  - Finding funding
- Qualifying as a 501 is challenging due to the lack of awareness about open source technology and a tendency to see OS as non-charitable activity.
- Creating a foundation is sensible for very large infrastructure projects, less so for smaller projects, due to the work resources and ongoing corporate sponsorship needed to create a sustainable organization.

9. Corporate programs

- Dedicating salaried time is one of the most important ways that companies contribute to open source
- Occasional donations to project crowdfunding campaigns
- “OS summer camps”: eg Google’s Summer of Code / Stripe’s Open-Source Retreat
- There is a risk that the first improvements to be prioritized will be those that directly benefit a developers’ employer.

10. Dedicated foundation support

- Focus specifically on supporting digital infrastructure
- Examples: Linux Foundation & Mozilla Foundation

10. Other institutional actors

- Support digital infrastructure in various ways
- Examples:
  - Github: chance to be open source utility
  - Venture Capital: have a stake in the future of digital infrastructure but they could not make investments into projects that didn’t have a business model
  - Academia: Play an important role in supporting digital infrastructure, especially in the development of new projects
