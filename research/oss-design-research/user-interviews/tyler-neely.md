# OSS Maintainer/Contributor/User Interview with Tyler

- 3 biggest problem with open source
  - things people rely on that are not actually maintained properly
  - most open source gets create as a hobby or through curiosity
    - lots of random stuff that's interesting but hasn't been built for the maturity of systems of scale
    - lot of OSS from corporate is better
  - not just time, but the fact that they get paid might make them take it more serious
  - ways of making money in OSS:
    - product as a company
    - provide service (consulting gigs)
    - grants
    - get investor to fund a company you start around
  - \*you have to do work to give your OSS away, by having a link to a place where people can contribute, you run the risk of actually having to maintain
-
-
- 3 biggest opportunities
  - provide more flexible funding options
    - platforms for selling licenses
    - platforms for directly investing in a project
    - backing it in a more flexible way > grants on a much smaller scale
  - allowing people to contribute in an easier way (contribute with money)
  - 45% of people on GitHub describe themselves as students, 28% as mediocre, 10% as actually experienced > this imbalance is an opportunity for those that are building OS communities
    - => aligning usage with contributions
  - free to try, pay for using it in commercial space
  - see a future where people are divided and exploded and they all work together collaboratives there will be giant companies and tiny ones, no middle ground
    - small company where people are curious
    - big company where people are comfortable
-
- what are the primitives
  - curiosity
  - allows experimentation
  - sharing of hobby project
  - job security / opportunity
  - self promotion
  - build with durability that is not connected to a company
  - flexibility
  - company perspective
    - recruiting
    - cost lower for bringing people in
    - cause you don't have to train the people in your ecosystem
    - shared body of knowledge people can rely on
    - trying to hire contributors of OSS
-
-
- Roles
  - owner/starter -> maintainer
  - contributors:
    - people at companies submitting pull requests (out of their needs) -> there's a operational costs connected to that
    - students that want to get into it (even higher costs might just teach them and never help again)
    - "weekend devs" limited amount of time might fix some bugs
    - students and weekend dev might actually become community members
  - users just use but never cost you anything
  - abuser ask you to add something so they would use your project
-
-
- list Tasks to do as maintainer
  - answer questions
  - feature requests
  - bug reports
  - reviewing PR most intensive part of it (reading other peoples code)
  - set ground rules ( contributions )
  - make my own patches and PR's (keep activities alive)
-
-
- lifecycle of project of Tyler
  - wanted to learn new programming language, wanted to have databases, wrote a library that let people use a database
  - saw there were some similar things, not very active, saw that I could do it better
  - opened a new repo from the start (empty repo)
  - working on it
  - functional project pretty quickly
  - asked some questions on IRC
  - got advice when was stuck
  - it would allow you to access a database, so people would look for the language and the database (eg python S3) and find the project
  - people have come in and became more active
  - I am the only one maintaining it and only one that has commit rights (would only do it if I trust the person) nobody has asked
  - lots contributions questions stars ...
  - starting to stop spending time on it, project works well for me, other peoples' PR's aren't necessary in line with me
  - once every 3 months, I'll check the PR's and merge the ones that can be merged immediately (always look at every line)
