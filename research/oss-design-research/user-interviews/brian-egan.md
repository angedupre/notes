  - Task driven, want to solve this
  - Not too small
  - Want to rely on community driven software
  - Doesn't need to be maintained if it's small and contained and solves the problem
  - Will read through the source, to get an overview, see the tests that are written
  - Popularity/maintenance is important but not main thing
  - Will fork and build it out like rxr but stayed part of og repo
