# Shadow Session Digest

## [180717_Tyler](./180717_Tyler.md)

- Rather looks at PR's then issues to move project ahead, doesn't have time to go through issues, plus too much noise
- Nice Github features
  - Once a user has contributed a merged pull request, they get the "contributor"-badge next to their name
  - If a PR contains a comment like this: "fix #123" the linked issue (#<issue number>) that issue will automatically be closed as well
- Sees small change in PR, would love to quickly fix it himself, but would have to clone & checkout this person's fork, too much work for small change.

## [180717_Brian](./180718_Brian.md)

- Got commit rights to some projects through being a solid contributor, always making sure to check in with the maintainer before doing large parts of work
- Wishes for a centralized issue managers across all OSS projects
  - Organized through labels (like board but labels decide where content goes)
  - "Awaiting reply"-label so that he knows he can ignore these
  - "You haven't responded in 5 days to these issues, you want to auto reply <...>"
- Uses insights/network tab to see who's building interesting features in their forks
- Contributors that have staked your project should be highlighted and their issues could be prioritized
