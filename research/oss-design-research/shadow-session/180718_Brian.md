# Shadowing Brian

## Becoming a maintainer

1.  Discovery: How did he get into the flutter ecosystem?
    - Liked flutter, but the toolset was missing a few pieces
    - Went to pub.dartlang.org to see if certain tools or libraries were there
    - Found an basic implementation of rxDart, something he wanted to use himself
    - Went through the docs to see what was implemented and what was missing
1.  Contribution:
    - Went to github
    - Filed an issue: documenting what was missing + some small bugs initially
    - Compared this implementation with how ReactiveX was implemented in other languages
    - Started suggesting different implementations in the repo in form of issues while volunteering to build it
    - Like to talk to a maintainer before making breaking changes
    - If maintainer is open to it, will spend his time on it
1.  Maintainer
    - After a few issues, PR's and conversations with the current maintainer, Brian became a collaborator in the project (got commit rights)

## Maintainer workflow

- Start with notifications emails in gmail
  - **Wishes for a centralized issue manager**
    - Has multiple issues on multiple repose
    - Wants to batch close/label/delete issues
    - **Auto add label "awaiting reply" when he was the last to comment so he can avoid having to look at that**
    - **"You haven't responded to this ticket in a few days, do you want to auto reply "..."?**
- Goes through emails one by one
  - If he can answer right away, will open the issue in github and answer there
  - If he can't answer right away -> mark email as unread, so he knows he needs to come back to it

## Random

- Looks at forks to figure out who could be an interesting contributor

## Ideas

- Can issue management work like these boards? Can labeling issues in different repos be the way to manage them in the issue management tool?
- Soft reputation
- Contributors that have staked your project should be highlighted and their issues could be prioritized
- Manage all OSS repos' issues as one
