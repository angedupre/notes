# Shadowing Tyler

- opens github, hadn't looked at his projects in a couple of months (since April)
- Had total of 132 notifications â€“ 27 of those on rustdb

1.  Goes to rustdb
1.  Goes to PR's first, there are 16
    _ **doesn't want to look at the issues because lack of time**
    _ In PR's looks at names of authors
    _ Found a recognizable name, but he broke the build dismissed the pr
    _ "ekmartin" posted 10 PR's
    _ checks profile for orgs he recognizes
    _ Related to MIT research \* Will prioritize this cause likes that kind of usage
1.  First easy pr
    _ was mentioned in an issue
    _ **In pr says "fixes #245" -> which will automatically close the issue if PR is merged**
    _ looks at code, looks good, test pass
    _ Comments "looks good will release a new crate with these changes"
    _ Merges PR
    _ Makes note for change log
1.  Goes over other PR's by ekmartin \* **ekmartin now has contributor badge next to name since one of his PR's has been merged into this repo**
1.  One PR had merge conflicts
    _ has to use github merge conflict tool to resolve that
    _ the tests rerun automatically \* Waits for that before merging
1.  Next PR the contributor made a small syntax error
    _ **would love to quickly fix that himself, but would have to checkout that fork and clone it locally to then change it. Too much work**
    _ Has to write the contributor to change it
    _ This PR will not make it in these new versions
    _ _if you do end up making a fix in the github ui, it pushes a new commit on top of the contributors branch_
